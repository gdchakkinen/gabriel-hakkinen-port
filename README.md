Portfolio Overview
I am creating this portfolio to showcase my skills and knowledge in software development, as well as to demonstrate my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

Initially, I will be developing various screens and functionalities using React and Next.js to deliver value and enhance user experience. As the project progresses, I plan to integrate additional layers, including a backend built with .NET 8. There are also plans for potential deployment on cloud platforms such as Azure and/or AWS.

This portfolio serves not only as a demonstration of my current abilities but also as a testament to my ongoing journey in the tech industry. I look forward to sharing my progress and innovations as I expand my knowledge and expertise.
